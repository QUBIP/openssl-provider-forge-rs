//! This module provides traits, macros, and helper functions to facilitate the implementation
//! of [Operations][provider(7ossl)#Operations] for [OpenSSL Providers][provider(7ossl)]
//! (see [provider(7ossl)] for more details).
//!
//! # Purpose
//!
//! The utilities in this module are designed to streamline the process of implementing
//! [Operations][provider(7ossl)#Operations]
//! within an [OpenSSL Provider][provider(7ossl)],
//! ensuring consistency and reducing boilerplate code.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! This module is intended for developers working on OpenSSL Providers who need reusable
//! components to implement operations efficiently.
//!
//! It includes:
//! - Traits for defining common operation behaviors.
//! - Macros to simplify repetitive tasks.
//! - Helper functions for common tasks.
